# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to **JavaScript Mini Projects**, a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level frontend projects created to practice and improve JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. Each project is self-contained, visually engaging, and focuses on a specific JavaScript concept or user interaction pattern.

---

## Overview

This repository contains small, focused web applications built with vanilla JavaScript. These projects demonstrate a variety of features such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and responsive UI design.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Understand and manipulate the DOM
* Improve problem-solving through real use cases
* Build interactive and responsive UI components
* Learn clean and modular coding practices

---

## Project Structure

Each project resides in its own folder and includes the following:

* `index.html` — the main HTML structure
* `style.css` — styling and layout rules
* `script.js` — JavaScript logic and behavior

# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to **JavaScript Mini Projects**, a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level frontend projects created to practice and improve JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. Each project is self‑contained, visually engaging, and focused on a specific JavaScript concept or user‑interaction pattern.

---

## Overview

This repository hosts small, focused web applications built with vanilla JavaScript. The projects showcase DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and responsive UI design.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Understand and manipulate the DOM
* Improve problem‑solving through real use cases
* Build interactive and responsive UI components
* Write clean, modular, maintainable code

---

## Project Structure

Each project resides in its own folder and includes:

* `index.html` — markup
* `style.css` — styling rules
* `script.js` — JavaScript logic
